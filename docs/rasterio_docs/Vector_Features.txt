Vector Features

Rasterio’sfeaturesmodule provides functions to extract shapes of raster
features and to create new features by “burning” shapes into rasters:shapes()andrasterize(). These functions expose GDAL functions in
a general way, using iterators over GeoJSON-like Python objects instead of
GIS layers.

Extracting shapes of raster features

Consider the Python logo.

The shapes of the foreground features can be extracted like this:

The shapes iterator yields(geometry,value)pairs. The second item is the
value of the raster feature corresponding to the shape and the first is its
geometry.  The coordinates of the geometries in this case are in pixel units
with origin at the upper left of the image. If the source dataset was
georeferenced, you would get similarly georeferenced geometries like this:

For larger rasters, use the following shortcut withrasterio.band()instead
of reading the raster into an array.

Burning shapes into a raster

To go the other direction, userasterize()to burn values into the pixels
intersecting with geometries.

By default, only pixels whose center is within the polygon or that
are selected by Bresenham’s line algorithm will be burned in.
You can specifyall_touched=Trueto burn in all pixels touched by the geometry.
The geometries will be rasterized by the “painter’s algorithm” -
geometries are handled in order and later geometries will overwrite earlier values.

Again, to burn in georeferenced shapes, pass an appropriate transform for the
image to be created.

The values for the input shapes are replaced with255in a generator
expression. Areas not covered by input geometries are replaced with an
optionalfillvalue, which defaults to0. The resulting image,
written to disk like this,

has a black background and white foreground features.

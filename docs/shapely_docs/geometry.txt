Geometry#

Shapely geometry classes, such asshapely.Point, are the central data types
in Shapely.  Each geometry class extends theshapely.Geometrybase class,
which is a container of the underlying GEOS geometry object, to provide geometry
type-specific attributes and behavior.  TheGeometryobject keeps track of
the underlying GEOS geometry and lets the python garbage collector free its
memory when it is not used anymore.

Geometry objects are immutable. This means that after constructed, they cannot
be changed in place. Every Shapely operation will result in a new object being
returned.

Geometry types#

Point(*args)

A geometry type that represents a single coordinate.

LineString([coordinates])

A geometry type composed of one or more line segments.

LinearRing([coordinates])

Geometry type composed of one or more line segments that forms a closed loop.

Polygon([shell, holes])

A geometry type representing an area that is enclosed by a linear ring.

MultiPoint([points])

A collection of one or more Points.

MultiLineString([lines])

A collection of one or more LineStrings.

MultiPolygon([polygons])

A collection of one or more Polygons.

GeometryCollection([geoms])

Collection of one or more geometries that can be of different types.

Construction#

Geometries can be constructed directly using Shapely geometry classes:

Geometries can also be constructed from a WKT (Well-Known Text)
or WKB (Well-Known Binary) representation:

A more efficient way of constructing geometries is by making use of the
(vectorized) functions described inGeometry creation.

Pickling#

Geometries can be serialized using pickle:

Warning

Pickling will convert linearrings to linestrings.
Seeshapely.to_wkb()for a complete list of limitations.

Hashing#

Geometries can be used as elements in sets or as keys in dictionaries.
Python uses a technique calledhashingfor lookups in these datastructures.
Shapely generates this hash from the WKB representation.
Therefore, geometries are equal if and only if their WKB representations are equal.

Warning

Due to limitations of WKB, linearrings will equal linestrings if they contain the exact same points.
Seeshapely.to_wkb().

Comparing two geometries directly is also supported.
This is the same as usingshapely.equals_exact()with atolerancevalue of zero.

Formatting#

Geometries can be formatted to strings using properties, functions,
or a Python format specification.

The most convenient is to use.wkb_hexand.wktproperties.

More output options can be found using usingto_wkb(),to_wkt(), andto_geojson()functions.

A format specification may also be used to control the format and precision.

Shapely has a format specification inspired from Python’sFormat Specification Mini-Language, described next.

Semantic for format specification#

Format types'f'and'F'are to use a fixed-point notation, which is
activated by setting GEOS’ trim option off.

Format types'g'(default) and'G'are to use a “general format”,
where unnecessary digits are trimmed. This notation is activated by setting
GEOS’ trim option on. This option sometimes enablesScientific formatting.

For numeric outputs[fFgG], the precision is optional, and if not
specified, rounding precision will be disabled showing full precision.

Format types'x'and'X'show a hex-encoded string representation of
WKB or Well-Known Binary.

The upper case letter variant converts all non-numeric values to uppercase,
e.g.nantoNAN, oretoE.

Scientific formatting#

WKT outputs may sometimes use scientific formatting, depending on the GEOS
version, coordinate value and WKT writer options. GEOS versions 3.10 to 3.12
never use scientific formatting (only showing positional), while older and
newer versions may use scientific formatting for large and small coordinate
values (e.g.POINT(1.234e+181.234e-11)).

Scientific formatting can always be disabled by settingtrim=Falseforto_wkt()or other WKT writer methods,
which sets the WKT writer to use fixed-precision number formatting.

Canonical form#

When operations are applied on geometries the result is returned according to
some conventions.

In most cases, geometries will be returned in “mild” canonical form. There is
no goal to keep this form stable, so it is expected to change in future
versions of GEOS:

the coordinates of exterior rings follow a clockwise orientation and interior
rings have a counter-clockwise orientation. This is the opposite of the OGC
specifications because the choice was made before this was included in the
standard.the starting point of rings can be changed in the output, but the exact order
is undefined and should not be relied uponthe order of geometry types in a collection can be changed, but the order is
undefined

Whennormalize()is used, the “strict” canonical form is
applied. This type of normalization is meant to be stable, so changes to it
will be avoided if possible:

the coordinates of exterior rings follow a clockwise orientation and interior
rings have a counter-clockwise orientationthe starting point of rings is lower leftelements in collections are ordered by geometry type: by descending dimension
and multi-types first (MultiPolygon, Polygon, MultiLineString, LineString,
MultiPoint, Point). Multiple elements from the same type are ordered from
right to left and from top to bottom.

It is important to note that input geometries do not have to follow these
conventions.

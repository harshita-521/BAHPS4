Testing#

The functions in this module are not directly importable from the rootshapelymodule. Instead, import them from the submodule as follows:

Utilities for testing with shapely geometries.

Raise an AssertionError if two geometry array_like objects are not equal.

Given two array_like objects, check that the shape is equal and all elements
of these objects are equal. An exception is raised at shape mismatch or
conflicting values. In contrast to the standard usage in shapely, no
assertion is raised if both objects have NaNs/Nones in the same positions.

Geometry or geometries to compare.

The tolerance to use when comparing geometries.

Whether to consider None elements equal to other None elements.

Whether to consider nan coordinates as equal to other nan coordinates.

Whether to normalize geometries prior to comparison.

The error message to be printed in case of failure.

If True, the conflicting values are appended to the error message.

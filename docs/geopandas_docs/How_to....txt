Drop duplicate geometry in all situations#

Using the standard Pandasdrop_duplicates()function on a geometry column can lead to some duplicate
geometries not being dropped, in certain circumstances. When used on a geometry columnm, the Pandas function compares the
WKB of each geometry object. This is sensitive to the orders of various components of the geometry - for example, a line
with co-ordinates in the order left-to-right should be equal to a line with the same co-ordinates in the order right-to-left,
but the WKB representations will be different. The same applies for the order of rings of polygons and parts in multipart
geometries.

To deal with this problem, use thenormalize()method first to order the co-ordinates in a canonincal form,
and then use the standarddrop_duplicates()method:

The effect of thenormalize()method can be seen in the following example:


--- CODE BLOCK ---
gdf["geometry"] = gdf.normalize()
gdf.drop_duplicates()

------------------



--- CODE BLOCK ---
>>> geopandas.GeoSeries([
...     shapely.LineString([(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0)]),
...     shapely.LineString([(2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0)]),
... ]).normalize().to_wkt()
0    LINESTRING (0 0, 1 0, 2 0)
1    LINESTRING (0 0, 1 0, 2 0)
dtype: object

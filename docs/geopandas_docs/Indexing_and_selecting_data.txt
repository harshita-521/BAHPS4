Indexing and selecting data#

GeoPandas inherits the standardpandasmethods for indexing/selecting data. This includes label based indexing withlocand integer position based indexing withiloc, which apply to bothGeoSeriesandGeoDataFrameobjects. For more information on indexing/selecting, see thepandasdocumentation.

In addition to the standardpandasmethods, GeoPandas also provides
coordinate based indexing with thecxindexer, which slices using a bounding
box. Geometries in theGeoSeriesorGeoDataFramethat intersect the
bounding box will be returned.

Using thegeoda.chile_labordataset, you can use this functionality to quickly select parts
of Chile whose boundaries extend south of the -50 degrees latitude. You can first check the original GeoDataFrame.

And then select only the southern part of the country.

Note
Your window decorations (title bar, etc.) may appear different
depending on your operating system and window manager.
The main QGIS GUI (
Fig. 3.1
) consists of five components /
component types:
Menu Bar
Toolbars
Panels
Map View
Status Bar
Scroll down for detailed explanations of these.
3.1.
Menu Bar

The Menu bar provides access to QGIS functions using standard
hierarchical menus.
The Menus, their options, associated icons and keyboard shortcuts are
described below.
The keyboard shortcuts can be reconfigured
(
Settings ► Keyboard Shortcuts
).
Most menu options have a corresponding tool and vice-versa.
However, the Menus are not organized exactly like the toolbars.
The locations of menu options in the toolbars are indicated below
in the table.
Plugins may add new options to Menus.
For more information about tools and toolbars, see
Toolbars
.
Note
QGIS is a cross-platform application.  Tools are generally
available on all platforms, but they may be placed in different
menus, depending on the operating systems.
The lists below show the most common locations, including known
variations.
3.1.1.
Project

The
Project
menu provides access and exit points for
project files
. It provides tools to:
Create a
New
project file from scratch or use another
project file as a template (see
Project files options
for template
configuration)
Open…
a project from a file, a GeoPackage, PostgreSQL
or Oracle database
Close
a project or revert it to its last saved state
Save
a project in
.qgs
or
.qgz
file
format, either as a file or within a GeoPackage, PostgreSQL or
Oracle database
Export the map canvas to different formats or use a
print layout
for more complex output
Set project properties and snapping options for geometry editing.

View

The map is rendered in map views. You can interact with these
views using the
View
tools. For example, you can:
Create new 2D or 3D map views next to the main map canvas
Zoom or pan
to any place
Query the attributes or geometry of the displayed features
Enhance the map view with preview modes, annotations or decorations
Access any panel or toolbar
The menu also allows you to reorganize the QGIS interface itself using
actions like:
Toggle Full Screen Mode
: covers the whole screen
while hiding the title bar
Toggle Panel Visibility
: shows or hides enabled
panels
- useful when digitizing features (for
maximum canvas visibility) as well as for (projected/recorded)
presentations using QGIS main canvas
Toggle Map Only
: hides panels, toolbars, menus and status
bar and only shows the map canvas. Combined with the full screen
option, it makes your screen display only the map

Layer

The
Layer
menu provides a large set of tools to
create
new data sources,
add
them to a project or
save modifications
to them.
Using the same data sources, you can also:
Duplicate
a layer to generate a copy where you can
modify the name, style (symbology, labels, …), joins, …
The copy uses the same data source as the original.
Copy
and
Paste
layers or groups from one
project to another as a new instance whose properties can be
modified independently.
As for
Duplicate
, the layers are still based on the same data source.
or
Embed Layers and Groups…
from another project, as
read-only copies which you cannot modify (see
Embedding layers from external projects
)
The
Layer
menu also contains tools to configure,
copy or paste layer properties (style, scale, CRS…).

Tip
Restoring toolbars
If you have accidentally hidden a toolbar, you can get it
back using
View ► Toolbars ►
(or
Settings ► Toolbars ►
).
If, for some reason, a toolbar (or any other widget) totally
disappears from the interface, you’ll find tips to get it back at
restoring initial GUI
.

Panels

QGIS provides many panels.
Panels are special widgets that you can interact with (selecting
options, checking boxes, filling values…) to perform more complex tasks.
Below is a list of the default panels provided by QGIS:

Status Bar

The status bar provides you with general information about the map
view and processed or available actions, and offers you tools to
manage the map view.
3.3.1.
Locator bar

On the left side of the status bar, the locator bar, a quick search
widget, helps you find and run any feature or options in QGIS:
Click in the text widget to activate the locator search bar or press
Ctrl
+
K
.
Type a text associated with the item you are looking for
(name, tag, keyword, …).
By default, results are returned for the enabled locator filters, but
you can limit the search to a certain scope by prefixing your text
with the
locator filters
prefix,
ie. typing
l
cad
will return only the layers whose name contains
cad
.
The filter can also be selected with a double-click in the menu that shows
when accessing the locator widget.
Click on a result to execute the corresponding action, depending on the type
of item.
Tip
Limit the lookup to particular field(s) of the active layer
By default, a search with the “active layer features” filter (
f
) runs
through the whole attribute table of the layer. You can limit the search to
a particular field using the
@
prefix. E.g.,
f
@name
sal
or
@name
sal
returns only the features whose “name” attribute contains ‘sal’.
Text autocompletion is active when writing and the suggestion can be applied
using
Tab
key.
A more advanced control on the queried fields is possible from the layer
Fields
tab. Read
Fields Properties
for details.
Searching is handled using threads, so that results always become available as
quickly as possible, even if slow search filters are installed.
They also appear as soon as they are encountered by a
filter, which means that e.g. a file search filter will show results one by one
as the file tree is scanned. This ensures that the UI is always responsive, even
if a very slow search filter is present (e.g. one which uses an online service).
Note
The Nominatim locator tool may behave differently (no autocompletion
search, delay of fetching results, …) with respect to the OpenStreetMap
Nominatim
usage policy
.
Tip
Quick access to the locator’s configurations
Click on the
icon inside the locator widget on the status bar to
display the list of filters you can use and a
Configure
entry that
opens the
Locator
tab of the
Settings ►
Options…
menu.
3.3.2.
Reporting actions

In the area next to the locator bar, a summary of actions you’ve
carried out will be shown when needed  (such as selecting features in
a layer, removing layer, pan distance and direction) or a long description of the tool you are
hovering over (not available for all tools).
In case of lengthy operations, such as gathering of statistics in
raster layers, executing Processing algorithms or rendering several
layers in the map view, a progress bar is displayed in the status bar.
3.3.3.
Control the map canvas

The
Coordinate
option shows the current
position of the mouse, following it while moving across the map view.
You can set the units (and precision) in the
Project ► Properties… ► General
tab.
Click on the small button at the left of the textbox to toggle between
the Coordinate option and the
Extents
option
that displays the coordinates of the current bottom-left and top-right
corners of the map view in map units.
Next to the coordinate display you will find the
Scale
display.
It shows the scale of the map view. There is a scale selector, which
allows you to choose between
predefined and custom scales
.
On the right side of the scale display, press the
button
to lock the scale to use the magnifier to zoom in or out.
The magnifier allows you to zoom in to a map without altering the map
scale, making it easier to tweak the positions of labels and symbols
accurately.
The magnification level is expressed as a percentage.
If the
Magnifier
has a level of 100%, then the current map
is not magnified, i.e. is rendered at accurate scale relative to the monitor’s resolution (DPI).
A default magnification value can be defined within
Settings ► Options ► Rendering ► Rendering Behavior
,
which is very useful for high-resolution screens to enlarge small
symbols. In addition, a setting in
Settings ► Options ► Canvas & Legend ► DPI
controls whether QGIS respects each monitor’s physical DPI or uses the overall system logical DPI.
To the right of the magnifier tool you can define a current clockwise
rotation for your map view in degrees.
On the right side of the status bar, the
Render
checkbox can be used to temporarily suspend the map view rendering
(see section
Controlling map rendering
).
To the right of the
Render
function, you find the
EPSG:code
button showing the current project CRS.
Clicking on this opens the
Project Properties
dialog and lets you
reproject the map view or adjust any other project property.
Tip
Calculating the Correct Scale of Your Map Canvas
When you start QGIS, the default CRS is
WGS
84
(EPSG
4326)
and
units are degrees. This means that QGIS will interpret any
coordinate in your layer as specified in degrees.
To get correct scale values, you can either manually change this
setting in the
General
tab under
Project ► Properties…
(e.g. to meters), or you
can use the
EPSG:code
icon seen above.
In the latter case, the units are set to what the project projection
specifies (e.g.,
+units=us-ft
).
Note that CRS choice on startup can be set in
Settings ► Options ► CRS Handling
.
3.3.4.
Messaging

The
Messages
button next to it opens the
Log Messages Panel
which has information on underlying
processes (QGIS startup, plugins loading, processing tools…)

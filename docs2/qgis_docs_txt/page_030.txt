Introducing QGIS projects

The state of your QGIS session is called a project.
QGIS works on one project at a time.
A setting can be project-specific or an application-wide default
for new projects (see section
Options
).
QGIS can save the state of your workspace into a
QGIS project file
using the menu options
Project ►
Save
or
Project ►
Save As…
.
Note
If the project has been modified the
*
symbol will appear in the title bar
and QGIS will, by default, ask you if you would like to save the changes.
This behavior is controlled by the
Prompt to save project and data source changes when required
setting under
Settings ► Options ► General
.
You can load existing projects into QGIS from the Browser panel or
by through
Project ►
Open…
,
Project ► New from template
or
Project ► Open Recent ►
.
At startup, a list of
Project Templates
and
Recent Projects
are displayed, including screenshots,
names and file paths (for up to ten projects).
The
Recent Projects
list is handy to access recently used
projects.
Double-click an entry to open the project or project template.
Right-click an entry to
Pin to List
,
Open Directory…
or
Remove from List
. If you see your project on the
Recent Projects
list but can’t find it in your file manager use
the
Open Directory…
option to help you locate projects that may
be missing, moved or renamed. You can also go to
Clear List
if
you want to remove all projects from the
Recent Projects
list.
If you have pinned projects, the
Clear List
action will be followed
by message box asking whether the pinned projects should also be removed.
You can also add a layer to create a new project automatically.
The lists will then disappear, giving way to the map canvas.
If you want to clear your session and start fresh, go to
Project ►
New
.
This will prompt you to save the existing project if
changes have been made since it was opened or last saved.
When you open a fresh project, the title bar will show
Untitled
Project
until you
save it.

The information saved in a project file includes:
Layers added
Which layers can be queried
Layer properties, including symbolization and styles
Layer notes
2D and 3D map views
Projection for each map view
Last viewed extent for each map
Print layouts
Print layout elements with settings
Print layout atlas settings
Digitizing settings
Table Relations
Project Macros
Project default styles
Plugins settings
QGIS Server settings from the OWS settings tab in the Project properties
Queries stored in the DB Manager
The project file is saved in XML format (see
QGS/QGZ - The QGIS Project File Format
).
This means that it is possible to edit the file outside of QGIS if you
know what you are doing.
The project file format has been updated several times.
Project files from older QGIS versions may not work properly any more.
Note
By default, QGIS will warn you of version differences.
This behavior is controlled in the
General
tab of
Settings ► Options
(
Warn when opening a project file saved with an older
version of QGIS
).
Whenever you save a
.qgs
project file in QGIS, a backup of the
file is created in the same directory as the project file, with the
extension
.qgs~
.
The extension for QGIS projects is
.qgs
but when saving from QGIS,
the default is to save using a compressed format with the
.qgz
extension.
The
.qgs
file is embedded in the
.qgz
file (a zip archive),
together with its associated SQLite database (
.qgd
) for
auxiliary data
.
You can get to these files by unzipping the
.qgz
file.
Note
The
Auxiliary Storage Properties
mechanism makes a zipped
project particularly useful, since it embeds auxiliary data.
Projects can also be saved/loaded to/from a PostgreSQL, GeoPackage or
Oracle database using the following Project menu items:
Project ► Open from
Project ► Save to
Both menu items have a sub-menu with a list of extra project storage
implementations (PostgreSQL, GeoPackage and Oracle).
Clicking the action will open a dialog to pick a GeoPackage connection
and project, a PostgreSQL connection, schema and project or Oracle
connection, owner and project.
Projects stored in GeoPackage, PostgreSQL or Oracle can also be loaded
through the QGIS browser panel, either by double-clicking them or by
dragging them to the map canvas.
2.2.
Handling broken file paths

When opening a project, QGIS may fail to reach some data sources due to
unavailable service/database, or to a renamed or moved file.
QGIS then opens the
Handle Unavailable Layers
dialog, referencing
the unfound layers.
You can:
Double-click in the
Datasource
field, adjust the path of
each layer and click
Apply changes
;
Select a row, press
Browse
to indicate the correct location
and click
Apply changes
;
Press
Auto-Find
to browse the folders and try to automatically fix
all or selected broken path(s). Be aware that the browsing may take some time.
Then click
Apply changes
.
Ignore the message and open your project with the broken path(s) by clicking
Keep Unavailable Layers
. Your layer is then displayed in the
Layers
panel, but without any data until you fix the path using
the
Unavailable layer!
icon next to it in the
Layers
panel, or
Repair Data Source…
in the
layer contextual menu.
With the
Repair Data Source…
tool, once a layer path has been
fixed, QGIS scans through all other broken paths and tries
to auto-fix those that have the same broken file path.
Remove Unavailable Layers
from the project.
Launching QGIS from command line using the
--skipbadlayers
option can
help you skip the
Handle Unavailable Layers
dialog at startup.
2.3.
Generating output

There are several ways to generate output from your QGIS session.
We have already discussed saving as a project file in
Introducing QGIS projects
.
Other ways to produce output files are:
Creating images:
Project ► Import/Export ►
Export Map to Image…
outputs the map canvas
rendering to an image format (PNG, JPG, TIFF…) at custom scale,
resolution and size. Including georeference information in the
exported image is possible, simply enable
Append georeference information (embedded or via world file)
.
See
Exporting the map view
for more details.
Exporting to PDF files:
Project ► Import/Export ► Export Map to PDF…
outputs the map canvas rendering to PDF at custom scale, resolution,
and with some advanced settings (simplification, georeferencing,
…).
See
Exporting the map view
for more details.
Exporting to DXF files:
Project ► Import/Export ► Export Project to DXF…
opens a dialog where you can define the ‘Symbology mode’, the
‘Symbology scale’ and vector layers you want to export to DXF.
Through the ‘Symbology mode’, symbols from the original QGIS
Symbology can be exported with high fidelity
(see section
Creating new DXF files
).
Designing maps:
Project ►
New Print Layout…
opens a dialog where you can
layout and print the current map canvas (see section
Laying out the maps
).

Resources
The QGIS Browser panel is a great tool for browsing, searching,
inspecting, copying and loading QGIS resources.
Only resources that QGIS knows how to handle are shown in the
browser.
Using the Browser panel you can locate, inspect and add data, as
described in
The Browser Panel
.
In addition, the Browser panel supports drag and drop of many QGIS
resources, such as project files, Python scripts, Processing scripts and
Processing models.
Python scripts, Processing scripts and Processing models can also be opened for
editing in an external editor and the graphical modeller.
You can drag and drop layers from the
Layers
panel
to the
Browser
panel, for instance into a GeoPackage or a
PostGIS database.
Fig. 4.1
The Browser panel

The browser panel (
Fig. 4.1
) is organised
as an expandable hierarchy with some fixed top-level entries that
organise the resources handled by the browser.
Node entries are expanded by clicking on
to the left
of the entry name.
A branch is collapsed by clicking on
.
The
Collapse All
button collapses all top-level
entries.
In
Settings ► Interface Customization
it is
possible to disable resources.
If you, for instance, would not like to show Python scripts in the
browser, you can uncheck the
Browser ► py
entry,
and if you want to get rid of your home folder in the browser, you
can uncheck the
Browser ► special:Home
entry.
A filter (
Filter Browser
) can be used for searching
based on entry names (both leaf entries and node entries in the
hierarchy).
Using the
Options
pull-down menu next to the filter
text field, you can
toggle
Case Sensitive
search
set the
Filter pattern syntax
to one of
Normal
Wildcard(s)
Regular Expressions
The
Properties widget
, showing useful information about some
entries / resources, can be enabled / disabled using the
Enable/disable properties widget
button.
When enabled, it opens at the bottom of the browser panel, as shown in
Fig. 4.2
.

A second browser panel can be opened by activating the
Browser (2)
panel in
View ► Panels
.
Having two browser panels can be useful when copying layers between
resources that are locationed deep down in different branches of the
browser hierarchy.


Often used file system locations can be tagged as favorites.
The ones you have tagged will appear here.
In addition to the operations described under
Home
, the
context menu allows you to
Rename Favorite…
and

.
4.2.2.
Spatial Bookmarks

This is where you will find your spatial bookmarks, organised
into
Project Bookmarks
and
User Bookmarks
.
From the top level context menu, you can create a bookmark
(

),
Show the Spatial Bookmark Manager
,
Import Spatial Bookmarks…
and

For bookmark group entries you can

For bookmark entries you can
Zoom to Bookmark

4.2.3.
Project Home

Available once the project file has been saved, the
Project home
entry is a folder containing data and other contents (scripts, models, text, …)
that may be used within the current project.
Displayed in the
Browser
panel, it allows you to quickly
access data and other files of the project.
It defaults to the project file folder but can be changed through the
Project ► Properties… ► General ► Project home
option,
or by right-clicking on the
Project Home
item of the Browser panel
and selecting
Set project home…
.
Customizing that folder is especially useful in contexts where QGIS projects
are not stored in the root folder of an organisational ‘project’, along with datasets.
4.2.4.
Drives and file system

The next items of the
Browser
panel depend on the OS in use
and concern the top level entries of its file system.
They are mainly:
The
Home
folder, pointing to the current user home folder
on Unix-based machines, the root
/
folder
the connected drives, either local or network. Depending on the OS,
they are directly listed (eg,
C:\
,
D:\
) or through the
/Volumes
entry.
From the contextual menu of each of these folders or drives, you can:
refresh the contents
create a
New ►
subitem that is a
Directory
,
GeoPackage
or ESRI
Shapefile
format dataset
hide the directory (
Hide from Browser
)
Set color
: customize the folder icon color, aiding in rapid
browser navigation of complex folder structures
enable
Scanning
:
Monitor for changes
: allows to manually control
whether a particular directory should be monitored and automatically updated.
This setting applies to the selected directory and all subdirectories.
This means that you can manually opt-in to monitoring of network drives
if you know there’s no issue, or manually opt-out of monitoring of large
directories which you don’t want monitored for other reasons.
By default, remote or network drives are not automatically monitored.

The different entries may also be available for some GDAL supported
vector file formats
such as ESRI File Geodatabase, FlatGeobuf, GeoParquet, NetCDF, … when compatible.
Note
When loading vector layers into QGIS, fields with
Field Domains
(such as those defined in a GeoPackage or ESRI File Geodatabase) are automatically
detected. These domains are database-level constraints, meaning they are enforced
by the database itself and apply across different applications, not just QGIS.

Sample Session: Loading raster and vector layers
This chapter provides a quick overview of installing QGIS, downloading QGIS
sample data, and running a first simple session visualizing raster and vector
data.
1.1.
Installing QGIS

QGIS project provides different ways to install QGIS depending on your platform.
1.1.1.
Installing from binaries

Standard installers are available for
MS Windows and
macOS. Binary
packages (rpm and deb) or software repositories are provided for many flavors of
GNU/Linux
.
For more information and instructions for your operating system check
https://download.qgis.org
.
1.1.2.
Installing from source

If you need to build QGIS from source, please refer to the installation
instructions. They are distributed with the QGIS source code in a file
called
INSTALL
. You can also find them online at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/release-3_40/INSTALL.md
.
If you want to build a particular release and not the version in development,
you should replace
master
with the release branch (commonly in the
release-X_Y
form) in the above-mentioned link (installation instructions may differ).
1.1.3.
Installing on external media

It is possible to install QGIS (with all plugins and settings) on a flash drive.
This is achieved by defining a
–profiles-path
option
that overrides the default
user profile
path and forces
QSettings
to use this directory, too.
See section
System Settings
for additional information.
1.1.4.
Downloading sample data

This user guide contains examples based on the QGIS sample dataset (also called
the
Alaska
dataset
).  Download the sample data from
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Sample-Data/archive/master.zip
and unzip the archive
on any convenient location on your system.
The Alaska dataset includes all GIS data that are used for the examples and
screenshots in this user guide; it also includes a small GRASS database.
The projection for the QGIS sample datasets is Alaska Albers Equal Area with
units feet. The EPSG code is 2964.

If you intend to use QGIS as a graphical front end for GRASS, you can find a
selection of sample locations (e.g., Spearfish or South Dakota) at the
official GRASS GIS website,
https://grass.osgeo.org/download/data/
.
1.2.
Starting and stopping QGIS

QGIS can be started like any other application on your computer.
This means that you can launch QGIS by:
using
the Applications menu,
the Start menu, or
the Dock
double clicking the icon in your Applications folder or desktop shortcut
double clicking an existing QGIS project file (with
.qgz
or
.qgs
extension). Note that this will also open the project.
typing
qgis
in a command prompt (assuming that QGIS is added to your PATH
or you are in its installation folder)
To stop QGIS, use:
the menu option
Project ► Exit QGIS
or use the
shortcut
Ctrl
+
Q
QGIS ► Quit QGIS
, or use the shortcut
Cmd
+
Q
or use the red cross at the top-right corner of the main interface of the application.
1.3.
Sample Session: Loading raster and vector layers

Now that you have
QGIS installed
and a
sample
dataset
available, we will demonstrate a first sample
session. In this example, we will visualize a raster and a vector layer.
We will use:
the
landcover
raster layer (
qgis_sample_data/raster/landcover.img
)
and the
lakes
vector layer (
qgis_sample_data/gml/lakes.gml
)
Where
qgis_sample_data
represents the path to the unzipped dataset.
Start QGIS as seen in
Starting and stopping QGIS
.
The data we will be working with are in
Albers
Equal
Area
,
so let’s set the project’s CRS accordingly:
Click the
Select projection
button
in the bottom right of QGIS interface.
The project properties dialog opens with the
CRS
tab active.
Type
̀`2964`
in the
Filter
text area.
Select the row with
NAD27
/
Alaska
Albers
CRS name.
Fig. 1.1
Select the Coordinate Reference System of data

Press
OK
Note
You can ignore/close for now the “ballpark transform” message
that could display.
Load the files in QGIS:
Click on the
Open Data Source Manager
icon.
The Data Source Manager should open in Browser mode.
Browse to the folder
qgis_sample_data/raster/
Select the ERDAS IMG file
landcover.img
and double-click it.
The landcover layer is added in the background while the Data Source
Manager window remains open.

Adding data to a new project in QGIS

To load the lakes data, browse to the folder
qgis_sample_data/gml/
,
and drag and drop the
lakes.gml
file over QGIS main dialog.
(Or just double-click as mentioned above.)
The
Select Items to Add
dialog opens, scanning the file.
This is due to
.gml
file format being able to store more than one layer at a time.
Fig. 1.3
Select layers within a file

In our case there is a single
lakes
layer.
Select it and press
Add Layers
.
The layer is added to the
Layers
panel
Close the Data Source Manager window
In the
Layers
panel, you can notice that the
lakes
layer
displays
Layer has no coordinate reference system set
next to it.
Let’s adjust that.
Click the
icon.
The
Coordinate Reference System Selector
dialog opens.
As done earlier, find and select the
NAD27 / Alaska Albers
CRS entry.
Click
OK
You now have the two layers available in your project in some random colours.
Let’s do some customization on the lakes layer.
Select the
Zoom In
tool on the
Navigation
toolbar
Zoom to an area with some lakes
Double-click the
lakes
layer in the map legend to open the
Properties
dialog
To change the lakes color:
Click on the
Symbology
tab
Select blue as fill color.
Fig. 1.4
Selecting Lakes color

Press
OK
. Lakes are now displayed in blue in the map canvas.
To display the name of the lakes:
Reopen the
lakes
layer
Properties
dialog
Click on the
Labels
tab
Select
Single labels
in the drop-down menu to enable labeling.
From the
Label with
list, choose the
NAMES
field.
Fig. 1.5
Showing Lakes names

Press
Apply
. Names will now load over the boundaries.
You can improve readability of the labels by adding a white buffer around them:
Click the
Buffer
tab in the list on the left
Check
Draw text buffer
Choose
3
as buffer size
Click
Apply
Check if the result looks good, and update the value if needed.
Finally click
OK
to close the
Layer Properties
dialog and apply the changes.

Let’s now add some decorations in order to shape the map and export it out of
QGIS:
Select
View ► Decorations ► Scale Bar
menu
In the dialog that opens, check
Enable Scale Bar
option
Customize the options of the dialog as you want
Press
Apply
Likewise, from the decorations menu, add more items (north arrow, copyright…)
to the map canvas with custom properties.
Click
Project ► Import/Export ►
Export Map to Image…
Press
Save
in the opened dialog
Select a file location, a format and confirm by pressing
Save
again.
Press
Project ►
Save…
to
store your changes as a
.qgz
project file.

That’s it! You can see how easy it is to visualize raster and vector layers in
QGIS, configure them and generate your map in an image format you can use in
other softwares. Let’s move on to learn more about the available functionality,
features and settings, and how to use them.
Note
To continue learning QGIS through step-by-step exercises, follow the

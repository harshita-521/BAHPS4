What are Vector Tiles?

Vector tiles are packets of geographic data, packaged into pre-defined
roughly-square shaped “tiles” for transfer over the web. They combine
pre-rendered raster map tiles and vector map tiles.
The vector tile server returns vector map data, which has been clipped
to the boundaries of each tile, instead of a pre-rendered map image.
The clipped tiles represent the zoom-levels of the vector tile service,
derived from a pyramid approach.
Using this structure, the data-transfer is reduced in comparison to
un-tiled vector maps. Only data within the current map view, and at the
current zoom level need to be transferred.
Also, compared to a tiled raster map, data transfer is also greatly reduced,
as vector data is typically much smaller than a rendered bitmap.
Vector tiles do not have any styling information assigned so QGIS needs to
apply a cartographic style in order to display the data.

Supported Formats

There is support for vector tiles through:
remote sources (HTTP/S) - with XYZ template -
type=xyz&url=http://example.com/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf
local files - with XYZ template - e.g.
type=xyz&url=file:///path/to/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf
local MBTiles database - e.g.
type=mbtiles&url=file:///path/to/file.mbtiles
To load a vector tiles dataset into QGIS, use the
Vector Tile
tab
in the
Data Source Manager
dialog.

The vector tiles
Layer Properties
dialog provides the following sections:

Also available in the
Layer styling panel
15.3.1.
Information Properties

The
Information
tab is read-only and represents an interesting
place to quickly grab summarized information and metadata on the current layer.
Provided information are:
based on the provider of the layer: name, URI, source type and path, number
of zoom levels
custom properties, used to store in the active project additional information about the layer.
More properties can be created and managed using PyQGIS, specifically through
the
setCustomProperty()
method.
the Coordinate Reference System: name, units, method, accuracy, reference
(i.e. whether it’s static or dynamic)
picked from the
filled metadata
: access,
extents, links, contacts, history…
15.3.2.
Source Properties

The
Source
tab displays basic information about
the selected vector tile, including:
the
Layer name
to display in the
Layers Panel
;
the
Coordinate Reference System
:
Displays the layer’s
Coordinate Reference System (CRS)
.
You can change the layer’s CRS, by selecting a recently used one in
the drop-down list or clicking on the
Select CRS
button (see
Coordinate Reference System Selector
).
Use this process only if the layer CRS is wrong or not specified.

Setting rules

As vector tiles consist of point, line and polygon geometries, the respective symbols are available.
To apply a cartographic style (with symbology and/or labels), you can either:
Use a
Style URL
when creating the
Vector Tiles Connection
.
The symbology will be shown immediately in the
Symbology
tab
after the layer is loaded in QGIS.
Or build your own symbology and labeling in the corresponding tabs of the layer properties.
By default, QGIS assigns an identical symbol to the features based on their geometry type.
In both cases, setting a style for a vector tile relies on a set of
rules
applied to the features, indicating:
a vector
symbol
or
label
a
Label
, a title for comprehensive identification of the rule
the name of a particular
Layer
the rule should apply to, if not applied to
(all
layers)
a
Min. Zoom
and a
Max. Zoom
, for the range of display.
Symbology and labeling can be dependent on the zoom level.
a
Filter
, a QGIS expression to identify the features to apply the style to
Each rule is added pressing the
Add rule
button
and selecting the type of symbols (
Marker
,
Line
,
Fill
)
corresponding to the features geometry type.
You can as well
Remove selected rules
or
Edit current rule
.
At the bottom the
Current Zoom
is shown.
Check the
Visible rules only
option at the top of the dialog
to filter the list of rules to only those that are visible at the current zoom level.
This makes it easier to work with complex vector styling and to locate troublesome rules.
The
Filter rules
text box also helps you easily find a rule,
by searching the
Label
,
Layer
and
Filter
fields.
In
Fig. 15.3
we set up style for the OpenStreetMap
landuse
layer.
For better visibility most of the rules are deselected.

Layer rendering

From the
Symbology
tab, you can also set some options that invariably act
on all features of the layer:
Opacity
: You can make the underlying layer in the map canvas visible with this tool.
Use the slider to adapt the visibility of your vector layer to your needs.
You can also make a precise definition of the percentage of visibility in the menu beside the slider.
Blending mode
: You can achieve special rendering effects with these tools
that you may previously only know from graphics programs.
The pixels of your overlaying and underlaying layers are mixed through the settings
described in
Blending Modes
.
15.3.3.3.
Styles

Available at the bottom of most of the tabs, the
Styles ►
menu provides shortcuts
to save, load, create, switch styles to apply to the vector tiles.
Vector tiles can have their style saved from QGIS as
QML
files
and they can be imported as:
QML
files (
QML - The QGIS Style File Format
)
MapBox GL Json
style configuration files

Under
Scale dependent visibility
,
you can set the
Maximum (inclusive)
and
Minimum (exclusive)
scales,
defining a range of scales in which features will be visible.
Out of this range, they are hidden.
The
Set to current canvas scale
button helps you
use the current map canvas scale as boundary of the range visibility.
See
Visibility Scale Selector
for more information.

The

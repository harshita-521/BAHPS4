Preparing Exercise Data

Important
This process is intended for course conveners, or more experienced
QGIS users who wish to create localised sample data sets for their course.
Default data sets are provided with the Training Manual, but you may follow
these instructions if you wish to replace the default data sets.
The
sample data provided
with the Training Manual
refers to the town of Swellendam and its surroundings. Swellendam is
located about 2 hours’ east of Cape Town in the Western Cape of South Africa.
The dataset contains feature names in both English and Afrikaans.
Anyone can use this dataset without difficulty, but you may prefer to use data
from your own country or home town. If you choose to do so, your localised
data will be used in all lessons from Module 3 to Module 7.2. Later modules use
more complex data sources which may or may not be available for your region.
Note
These instructions assume you have a good knowledge of QGIS and are
not intended to be used as teaching material.
20.1.
Create OSM based vector files

If you wish to replace the default data set with localised data for your course,
this can easily be done with tools built into QGIS. The region you choose to use
should have a good mix of urban and rural areas, containing roads of differing
significance, area boundaries (such as nature reserves or farms) and surface
water, such as streams and rivers.
Open a new QGIS project
Select
Layer ► Data Source Manager
to open the
Data Source Manager
dialog
In the
Browser
tab, expand the
XYZ Tiles
drop-down menu
and double-click the
OpenStreetMap
item.
A map of the world is now visible on the map canvas.
Close the
Data Source Manager
dialog
Move to the area you’d like to use as study area
Now that we have the area we’ll extract the data from, let’s enable the extraction
tools.
Go to
Plugins ► Manage/Install Plugins…
In the
All
tab, type
QuickOSM
in the search box
Select the QuickOSM plugin, press
Install Plugin
and then
Close
the dialog.
Execute the new plugin from
Vector ► QuickOSM ► QuickOSM…
menu
In the
Quick query
tab, select
building
in the
Key
drop-down menu
Leave the
Value
field empty, meaning that you are querying all
buildings.
Select
Canvas Extent
in the next drop-down menu
Expand the
Advanced
group below and uncheck all
geometry types on the right except
Multipolygons
.
Press
Run query
A new
building
layer is added to the
Layers
panel, showing
buildings in the selected extent.
Proceed as above to extract other data:
Key
=
landuse
and
Multipolygons
geometry type.
Key
=
boundary
,
Value
=
protected_area
and
Multipolygons
geometry type.
Key
=
natural
,
Value
=
water
and
Multipolygons
geometry type.
Key
=
highway
and check
Lines
and
Multilines
geometry types.
Key
=
waterway
,
Value
=
river
and check
Lines
and
Multilines
geometry types.
Key
=
place
and
Points
geometry type.
This process adds the layers as temporary files (indicated by the
icon next to their name).
You can sample the data your region contains in order to see what kind of
results your region will yield.
We now need to save the resulting data to use during your
course. We’ll be using ESRI Shapefile, GeoPackage and SpatiaLite formats
depending on the data.
To convert the
place
temporary layer to another format:
Click the
icon next to the
place
layer
to open the
Save Scratch Layer
dialog.
Note
If you need to change any of the temporary layer’s properties (CRS, extent,
fields…), use the
Export
► Save Features as…
contextual menu instead, and ensure the
Add
saved file to map
option is checked. This adds a new layer.
Select the
ESRI Shapefile
format
Use the
…
button to browse to the
exercise_data/shapefile/
folder and save the file as
places.shp
.
Press
OK
In the
Layers
panel, the temporary
place
layer is
replaced with the saved
places
shapefile layer and
the temporary icon next to it removed.
Double-click the layer to open its
Layer Properties ►
Source
tab and update the
Layer name
property to match the file
name.
Repeat the process for other layers, renaming them as follows:
natural_water
into
water
waterway_river
into
rivers
boundary_protected_area
into
protected_areas
Each resulting data set should be saved in the
exercise_data/shapefile/
directory.
The next step is to create a GeoPackage file from the
building
layer
to use during the course:
Click the
icon next to the
building
layer
Select the
GeoPackage
format
Save the file as
training_data.gpkg
under the
exercise_data/
folder
By default, the
Layer name
is filled as the file name.
Replace it with
buildings
.
Press
OK
Rename the layer in its properties dialog
Repeat the process with the
highway
layer, saving it as
roads
in
the same GeoPackage database.
The last step is to save the remaining temporary file as a SpatiaLite file.
Click the
icon next to the
landuse
layer
Select the
SpatiaLite
format
Save the file as
landuse.sqlite
under the
exercise_data/
folder. By default, the
Layer name
is filled as the file name.
Do not change it.
Press
OK
You should now have a map which looks something like this (the symbology will
certainly be very different, because QGIS randomly assigns colors when layers
are added to the map):
The important thing is that you have 7 vector layers matching those
shown above and that all those layers have some data.
20.2.
Create SRTM DEM tiff files

For modules
Module: Creating Vector Data
and
Module: Rasters
, you’ll also need
raster images (SRTM DEM) which cover the region you have selected for your
course.
The
CGIAR-CGI
provides some SRTM DEM you can download
from
https://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/srtmdata/
.
You’ll need images which cover the entire region you have chosen to use.
To find the extent coordinates, in QGIS ,
zoom to the extent of
the largest layer and pick the values in the
Extents
box of the status bar.
Keep the
GeoTiff
format. Once the form is filled, click on the
Click here to Begin Search >>
button and download the file(s).
Once you have downloaded the required file(s), they should be saved in the
exercise_data
directory, under
raster/SRTM
subfolders.
20.3.
Create imagery tiff files

In Module
Module: Creating Vector Data
,
★☆☆ Follow Along: Data Sources
lesson shows
close-up images of three school sports fields
which students are asked to digitize. You’ll therefore need to reproduce these
images using your new SRTM DEM tiff file(s). There is no obligation to use school
sports fields: any three school land-use types can be used (e.g. different
school buildings, playgrounds or car parks).
For reference, the image in the example data is:
20.4.
Replace tokens

Having created your localized dataset, the final step is to replace the tokens
in the
substitutions.txt
file so that the appropriate names will appear
in your localized version of the Training Manual.
The tokens you need to replace are as follows:
majorUrbanName
: this defaults to “Swellendam”. Replace with the name of
the major town in your region.
schoolAreaType1
: this defaults to “athletics field”. Replace with the
name of the largest school area type in your region.
largeLandUseArea
: this defaults to “Bontebok National Park”. Replace
with the name of a large landuse polygon in your region.
srtmFileName
: this defaults to
srtm_41_19.tif
. Replace this
with the filename of your SRTM DEM file.
localCRS
: this defaults to
WGS
84
/
UTM
34S
. You should replace
this with the correct CRS for your region.

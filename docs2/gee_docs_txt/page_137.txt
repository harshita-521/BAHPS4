To save only the first match for each element in a collection, use an
ee.Join.saveFirst()
.  The
saveFirst()
join functions in an
      equivalent way to the
saveAll()
join, except for each element in the
primary
collection, it simply saves the first element from the
secondary
collection matching the condition specified in the
ee.Filter
.  Unmatched elements in the
primary
collection
      are dropped.  Unless a sorting property and an order are supplied (as in the
saveAll example
), the first element saved might be
      any of the elements in the list found by
saveAll()
with the same filter.

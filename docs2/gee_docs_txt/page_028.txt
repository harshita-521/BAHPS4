Google Earth Engine is a
Google Cloud product
for geospatial
analysis at scale. It combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and
geospatial datasets with planetary-scale computation to accelerate environmental
research and applications.
Key Features
Geospatial analysis, simplified and scalable
Earth Engine integrates an extensive geospatial
data
catalog
with distributed computing, accessible through
client libraries. Users can access a wide range of satellite and environmental
data, as well as
incorporate their own datasets
. The platform
simplifies geospatial analysis by automatically handling data projection,
scaling, and compositing based on user-specified parameters. Its
analytical
functions
operate efficiently across different scales without
requiring explicit data preparation steps or chunking. By managing complex data
processing and computational scaling internally, Earth Engine enables users to
focus on analysis rather than technical setup.
Processing environments
Earth Engine supports
two modes of analysis
:
Interactive mode
: For rapid real-time data exploration and visualization
of small amounts of data.
Batch mode
: For large-scale computationally intensive tasks on large
amounts of data.
Development environments
Developers can choose between two primary development environments:
Python client library
: A flexible interface to Earth Engine for
integration with the broader Python ecosystem, facilitating advanced
workflows, and interactive analysis in Jupyter notebooks.
JavaScript Code Editor
: A dedicated web-based development environment for
rapid prototyping, exploration, and Earth Engine App creation.
Visualization and results
Earth Engine supports geospatial analysis from initial prototyping to final data
export. Its efficient tiling and computation system, integrated with interactive
map widgets, provides rapid visualization and inspection capabilities in both
the Code Editor and Python environments. This allows for immediate data
exploration and iteration. When ready, users can
export
raster
and vector results to Google Cloud Storage, BigQuery, or Google Drive, as well
as download data locally in formats compatible with pandas, NumPy, and Xarray.
Additionally, Earth Engine supports the creation of
interactive web
applications
, enabling users to share their geospatial insights with
a wide audience.
Machine learning
Machine learning tools
for regression, classification, image
segmentation, and accuracy assessment are built into Earth Engine. Once trained,
models can be saved and applied repeatedly. Classical ML workflows are
streamlined within Earth Engine's integrated system. For more advanced options
or externally trained models, integration with
Vertex AI
is
provided, allowing models to be brought to Earth Engine's data or enabling the
construction of deep learning models and neural network-based analyses.
Access and management
Earth Engine is available for both
commercial
and
noncommercial
use. Noncommercial use is offered free of
charge, while commercial use is subject to a
subscription fee and compute
charges
. All computation and private data are associated with Google
Cloud projects, providing users with control over access, resource management,
and usage monitoring through the Google Cloud Console. This integration allows
for centralized project management, detailed billing information, and the
application of Google Cloud's robust security and compliance features. Users can
take advantage of Identity and Access Management (IAM) to
control
permissions
and can
log activities
and
monitor
resource usage
with Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging.

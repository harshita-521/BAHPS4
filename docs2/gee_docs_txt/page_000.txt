You can export images, map tiles, tables and video from Earth Engine. The
exports can be sent to your Google Drive account, to
Google Cloud
Storage
or to a new Earth Engine asset.
To use Google Cloud Storage (a fee-based service), you'll need to set up a
project, enable billing for the project, and create a storage bucket. See the
Cloud Storage Quickstart
page
for
instructions. See
this
guide
for information on
storage bucket naming. Data exported to a Cloud Storage bucket will have the
bucket's
default object Access Control List
(ACL)
.
You must have write permission for the specified bucket.
Choose an option from the side menu to learn more about batch exporting
images
and
tables
,

programmatically, and more.

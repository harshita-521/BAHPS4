A geometry created in Earth Engine is either geodesic (i.e. edges are the shortest path
      on the surface of a sphere) or planar (i.e. edges are the shortest path in a 2-D Cartesian
      plane).  No one planar coordinate system is suitable for global collections of features,
      so Earth Engine's geometry constructors build geodesic geometries by default.  To make a
      planar geometry, constructors have a
geodesic
parameter that can be set
      to
false
:
Code Editor (JavaScript)
var
planarPolygon
=
ee
.
Geometry
(
polygon
,
null
,
false
);
Figure 1 shows the difference between the default geodesic polygon and the result of
      converting the polygon to a planar representation.
Figure 1.  A geodesic polygon (red) and a planar polygon (black).
You can convert between geodesic and planar geometries using the
ee.Geometry
constructor.

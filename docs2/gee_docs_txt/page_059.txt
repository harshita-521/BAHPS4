Welcome to the Google Earth Engine tutorial for using
Hansen et al. (2013)
global
      forest cover and change data and Forest Monitoring for Action (FORMA,
Hammer
        et al. 2009
) data from
Global Forest
      Watch
. This tutorial provides examples of how to use Earth Engine to visualize these
      data, how to compute forest change over time and other statistics within a region of
      interest and how to download both the data and results of analyses.

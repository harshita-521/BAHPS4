Keep your client library up to date by running the command for the package manager you used to
      install
earthengine-api
:
Conda Package Manager
:
conda update -c conda-forge earthengine-api
Python Package Installer
:
pip install earthengine-api --upgrade
Python support
The Earth Engine Python client library is compatible with
Python versions
        supported by Google Cloud
. Support is updated annually following the Python point
      release schedule (
PEP 602
;
Status of Python versions
). Using
      unsupported Python versions may cause authentication failures, unexpected behavior, or failure
      of certain operations.
Install options
If you are using
Google Colab
, the latest version of the Earth Engine Python
      client library has already been installed (via pip). Try the following notebook to get started
      with Earth Engine and Colab:
Run in Google Colab
View source on GitHub
If you don't use Colab, the Earth Engine client library can be manually installed and
      updated on your system using
conda
(recommended) or
pip
:
Install with
conda
Install with
pip
expand_more
Install
the API to an
          arbitrary Python environment using
pip
. From a terminal or
          command prompt:
pip install earthengine-api
Once installed, you can import, authenticate and initialize the Earth Engine API as
          described
here
.
Update
the API:
pip install earthengine-api --upgrade
Package import
The Python API package is called
ee
. It must be imported and initialized for
      each new Python session and script:
import
ee
Authentication and Initialization
Prior to using the Earth Engine Python client library, you need to
      authenticate and use the resultant credentials to initialize the Python
      client. Run:
ee
.
Authenticate
()
This will select the best authentication mode for your environment, and prompt
      you to confirm access for your scripts.  To initialize, you will need to provide
      a project that you own, or have
permissions
to use. This project will be used for running all Earth Engine operations:
ee
.
Initialize
(
project
=
'my-project'
)
See the
authentication
      guide
for troubleshooting and to learn more about authentication modes
      and Cloud projects.
Hello world!
Here is a short script to test that you're all set for working with Earth Engine.

Syntax
Both the Python and JavaScript APIs access the same server-side functionality,
      but client-side expressions (
learn more about client vs. server
)
      can vary because of language syntax differences. The following table includes
      a list of the common syntax differences you'll encounter
      when working with the Python API relative to the JavaScript API.

#
Notes regarding Python API syntax:
Anonymous function mapping is achieved via
lambda
functions, which accept only a single expression. Use traditional
          named functions when complex mapping operations are required.
Function arguments provided as a keyword arguments dictionary must be
          specified as
**kwargs
;
          i.e., prepend two asterisks to the function input dictionary:
y = fun(**{'x': 0})
or
y = fun(**arg_dict)
.
Date objects
Define and manipulate client-side date objects with the
datetime
module. Include the module in your script:
import
datetime
Convert
ee.Date
to client-side date:
ee_date
=
ee
.
Date
(
'2020-01-01'
)
py_date
=
datetime
.
datetime
.
utcfromtimestamp
(
ee_date
.
getInfo
()[
'value'
]
/
1000.0
)
Convert client-side date to
ee.Date:
py_date
=
datetime
.
datetime
.
utcnow
()
ee_date
=
ee
.
Date
(
py_date
)
Exporting data
Exporting data with the Python API requires the use of the
ee.batch
module, which provides an interface to the
Export
functions. Pass parameter arguments as you would with the JavaScript API, minding the
      differences noted in the
syntax table
above. Export tasks must be
      started by calling the
start()
method on a defined task. Query a task's status by
      calling the
status()
method on it. The following example demonstrates exporting
      an
ee.Image
object.
Create an export task:
task
=
ee
.
batch
.
Export
.
image
.
toDrive
(
image
=
my_image
,
# an ee.Image object.
region
=
my_geometry
,
# an ee.Geometry object.
description
=
'mock_export'
,
folder
=
'gdrive_folder'
,
fileNamePrefix
=
'mock_export'
,
scale
=
1000
,
crs
=
'EPSG:4326'
)
Start an export task:
task
.
start
()
Check export task status:
task
.
status
()
The result of
task.status()
is a dictionary containing information such as the
      state of the task and its ID.
{
'state'
:
'READY'
,
'description'
:
'my_export_task'
,
'creation_timestamp_ms'
:
1647567508236
,
'update_timestamp_ms'
:
1647567508236
,
'start_timestamp_ms'
:
0
,
'task_type'
:
'EXPORT_IMAGE'
,
'id'
:
'56TVJIZABUMTD5CJ5YHTMYK4'
,
'name'
:
'projects/earthengine-legacy/operations/56TVJIZABUMTX5CJ5HHTMYK4'
}
You can monitor task progress using the
state
field. See the Processing
      Environments page for a
list of
state
values
and more information on
task lifecycle
.
Note:
Tasks started from the Python API will also appear in the Tasks
      tab of the JavaScript
Code Editor
for the
      same Google account.
Printing objects
Printing an Earth Engine object in Python prints the serialized request for the object,
      not the object itself. Refer to the
Client vs. server
page
      to understand the reason for this.
Call
getInfo()
on Earth Engine objects to get the desired object from the server
      to the client:
# Load a Landsat image.
img
=
ee
.
Image
(
'LANDSAT/LT05/C02/T1_L2/LT05_034033_20000913'
)
# Print image object WITHOUT call to getInfo(); prints serialized request instructions.
print
(
img
)
# Print image object WITH call to getInfo(); prints image metadata.
print
(
img
.
getInfo
())
Note that
getInfo()
is a synchronous operation, meaning execution of expressions
    following the
getInfo()
call are blocked until the result is returned to the client.
    Additionally, requests for a lot of data or expensive computations can return an error and/or
    hang. In general, the best practice is to
export your results
,
    and once complete, import them into a new script for further analysis.
Caution:
Calling
getInfo()
in your script will block execution.
      Additionally, requests for a lot of data or expensive computations can return an error
      and/or hang.
Export
to obtain the
        results of expensive, large, or long running computations.
UI objects
The Earth Engine
ui
module is only available through the JavaScript API Code
      Editor. Use third party libraries for UI elements in Python. Libraries such as
geemap
,
Folium
, and
ipyleaflet
provide interactive map display, while charting can be done with
Matplotlib
,
Altair
, or
seaborn
, to name a few. See examples
      in the
Earth Engine in Colab setup notebook
for using geemap and Matplotlib.
Python in the Developer Guide
Python code is included throughout the Earth Engine Developer Guide. Where available,
      code examples can be viewed by clicking on the "Colab (Python)" tab at the top of code blocks.
      Guide pages may also include buttons at the top for running the page as a Colab notebook or
      viewing on GitHub. Python code examples are intended to be run using
Google Colab
. Interactive map and object exploration are
      handled by the
geemap
library. Both the Earth Engine Python client library and
geemap
are preinstalled
      in Colab.
Earth Engine setup
Running Python code requires that you import the Earth Engine library, authenticate,
      and initialize. The following commands are used in examples
      (see the
Authentication and Initialization
page for
      alternatives).
import
ee
ee
.
Authenticate
()
ee
.
Initialize
(
project
=
'my-project'
)
Interactive exploration with
geemap
The
geemap
library is used
      for displaying map tiles and printing rich representations of Earth Engine objects.
      The library depends respectively on
ipyleaflet
and
eerepr
for these features.
      The
geemap
library and its dependencies are preinstalled in Google Colab;
      import it into each session.
import
geemap.core
as
geemap
Geographic Earth Engine data classes, such as
ee.Image
and
ee.FeatureCollection
, can be viewed using the
geemap.Map
object.
      First, define the map object. Then, add layers to it or alter its viewport.
# Initialize a map object.
m
=
geemap
.
Map
()
# Define an example image.
img
=
ee
.
Image
.
random
()
# Add the image to the map.
m
.
add_layer
(
img
,
None
,
'Random image'
)
# Display the map (you can call the object directly if it is the final line).
display
(
m
)

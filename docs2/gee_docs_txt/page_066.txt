The Earth Engine API is composed of objects and methods. Objects represent data
types such as raster images, vector features, numbers, and strings.
Each of these objects belongs to a specific class, and each class has a
strict set of functions available to it.
Objects and methods are combined in workflow scripts and sent to Earth Engine
servers for processing. Learn about common object classes and their methods by
clicking on the following cards to see example procedures.
The full list of Earth Engine classes and their methods can be found in the
Client Libraries
section of the
API Reference Guide
(e.g.
ee.Image.add
). The same
reference information is also available under the JavaScript Code Editor
Docs
tab.

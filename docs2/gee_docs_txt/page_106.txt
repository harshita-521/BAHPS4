Cloud AI Platform is deprecated and access will be discontinued January 31 2025.
The easiest way to migrate is to following Vertex AI's
migration page in the Cloud Console
.
Otherwise you can manually migrate with the following steps.
Manual Migration
Re-upload your Cloud AI Platform model to Vertex AI. Be careful to ensure
that the uploaded model is using the same ML library when choosing the
container image to use otherwise the model may not successfully deploy at a
later step.
Create a new Vertex AI endpoint for your hosted model.
Deploy your uploaded model to the new Vertex AI endpoint.
Update any references from
ee.Model.fromAiPlatformPredictor
to
ee.Model.fromVertexAi
in all of your code using Earth Engine and in the
endpoint
field use the new endpoint name that you created in step 2.
Tip:
When re-deploying your model to Vertex AI consider using a
gRPC prediction format
.
